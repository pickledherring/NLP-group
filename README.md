## CODWOE
To test our code we have included the [trial data](trial-data_all) in the repository. It is split into train and test groups within the notebooks, which contain the data cleaning and models. The gloss to sgns code is included in gloss2sgns.ipynb, likewise, gloss to electra is gloss2electra.ipynb. As these notebooks were designed on Google Colab, they can simply be run there. If you would rather run them on your own machine, clone this repository, then:<br>
`cd NLP-group`<br>
`pip install -r INSTALL.txt`<br>
and you should be good to go!
